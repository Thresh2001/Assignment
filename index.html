    <h2>Welcome to the 2025 Shanghai F1</h2>
    <p>This is a website dedicated to commemorating the 2025 F1 Shanghai Station trip. The following video was created on May 20th, 2023</p>
    <p>I have actually wanted to make this video for a long time, and it was delayed until the day before the departure of the Shanghai station. I still have several DDLs on hand, but I still feel that not making it will leave some regrets. Rather than riding on the popularity of the Shanghai station, it's better to keep it as a diary as a souvenir for my future self.</p>
