    <h2>Saturday Events</h2>

    <h3>Sprint Race</h3>
    <p>Lewis Hamilton has claimed victory in the first Sprint of the 2025 season at the Chinese Grand Prix, the Ferrari driver putting in an assured drive to add to his tally of wins in Shanghai and claim his debut P1 for the Scuderia.</p>
    <p>After a strong start when the lights went out, Hamilton went on to build a commanding lead and – while it was not entirely smooth sailing, his SF-25 experiencing graining on the tyres at one stage – the seven-time World Champion looked in stunning form across the 19-lap event.</p>
    <p>Max Verstappen spent much of the Sprint running in second but lost out to McLaren’s Oscar Piastri with a few laps to spare, putting the Red Bull in third, while Mercedes’ George Russell held onto fourth despite a late-race battle with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, the latter having to settle for fifth.</p>
    <p>Yuki Tsunoda was an impressive sixth for Racing Bulls, ahead of Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli adding to the points he gained in Melbourne with two more in seventh. Lando Norris, meanwhile, ended the event in eighth after a wide moment early on cost him places, with the McLaren running out of the points for some time before snatching the position in the closing stages.</p>

    <h3>Qualifying</h3>
    <p>Oscar Piastri narrowly got the better of Mercedes rival George Russell and McLaren team mate Lando Norris during Qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, securing his first-ever Formula 1 pole position in the process.</p>
    <p>Piastri delivered a time of 1m 30.703s on the opening runs of the decisive pole shootout and improved to a 1m 30.641s with his second effort, giving him P1 over Russell by just under one tenth of a second.</p>
    <p>Russell found a chunk of lap time with his final lap to the chequered flag, brilliantly securing a spot on the front row of the grid alongside Piastri, and leaving championship leader Norris to settle for third position.</p>
    <p>Reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen took fourth, with the Ferraris of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc this time winding up in P5 and P6 respectively – the Briton unable to repeat his Sprint heroics.</p>
    <p>Racing Bulls starred throughout Qualifying, with Isack Hadjar achieving a fine seventh on the grid and team mate Yuki Tsunoda placing ninth, around the other Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, as Williams’ Alex Albon completed the top 10 places.</p>

    <p>Haas driver Esteban Ocon enjoyed a much stronger outing to reach Q2 and earn 11th on the grid, while Melbourne points scorer Nico Hulkenberg put his Kick Sauber 12th over the Aston Martins of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll.</p>
    <p>Carlos Sainz could not quite match the pace of team mate Albon as he dropped out of the second phase in 15th position, the Spaniard still trying to build up confidence in the Williams challenger following his switch from Ferrari.</p>
    <p>As per Sprint Qualifying, Alpine lost both cars at the Q1 hurdle, with Pierre Gasly falling agonisingly short of Q2 in 16th and Jack Doohan taking 18th after a mistake on his final lap – the team mates sandwiching Haas rookie Ollie Bearman.</p>
    <p>Gabriel Bortoleto was 19th in the second of the Sauber machines, while Liam Lawson endured another tough session as he ended 20th and last on the Qualifying timesheets – the RB21 proving to be a tricky beast for him to tame.</p>
